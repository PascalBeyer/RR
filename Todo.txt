Make a good general purpose allocator // done?
reenable shadow mapping // done?
do a good StoF, so that we have a better mesh. // done ? (at least for now)
make the meshstruct work like it does in soko? having a vertex pool, an index pool and then have list {start index, amount, materialIndex}? // yes!, and now they do.
Make own mesh format and material format, that respects how the game wants to think of them // done ?
do tileMap editor // done?
somehow the colors of that consoleTextField got mixed up.... it seems that r and b are switched, why no where else? // done?
Make everything an entity, like they have in Sokoban? // no.
Maybe make a catalog system, which looks at whats there on startup // done?
Move to front Asset system? // done?
Make meshes assets again. // done?
grid positions and offsets // done?
move the main render loop into each state. // done?
linear array of events waiting for results, i.e. spawned bock, waiting for put into goal. // done?
do actual level in path creator, and just render the "Level" (constant, that we load from) // done?
progress bar // done?
detect whether or not a in the path creator suggested move is possible. // done?
escape to close console. // done?
we could do it so you can pass in NULL instead of exe, so the path creator does not need to know. // done?
FIX EDITOR PASTE + MAKE EDITOR ARROW KEYS BE DEPENDEndent on cam direction. // done?

Asset:
how to handle textured and untextured entities? Should there be such a thing as untextured entity, probably not.
Asset system has to handle materials. // no, well maybe
Get PNG loader
make font into asset, would also make the draw String call way better, also solves the problem where I do not currently know where it is supposed to be stored
Newly added assets should go into the asset system, not sure how.

Tweekers:
make tweek search the file, if no loaded tweeker variable is found. maybe write out the tweekerfile instead of writing out all tweeker values.
make tweeker work based on filenames as well I.e. tweek editor meshSelectColor instead of having to use editorMeshSelectColor
maybe load all tweekers on startup?

MISC:
Do the "start" of a level and make it so we can save levels. Should we do like a place units sequence?
maybe we place the goals
reduce api calls in opengl
associating data to triangles, to open gl... like normals.
We need to handle dt of more then one cycle at some point
We could go from a "tileMap" system to a "traversables" system?
render strings leftbound
make debug Ui for amount of memory used.

add starting cam pos to level // done?
add lightPos to the level
add Blocks needed to level //done

EDITOR : 
save (crtl-s) //done?
camera for tilemap editor //done ?
make us able to shift click to remove, if already in selection // done?
multi select // done?
copy paste // done?
undo, redo, // done?
double click = 'numpad .'
box select
make the orbiting more of a always usable flag, maybe just a bool.
make the cancel work off of the undo system, once it is in place // no, undo relies on this
(brightness/ negative colors?)
Euler thing
paste of rows
UndoRedo has error with scale pushing one even if nothing selected

Level idears
2 guys, stone.
halving the path (path that one guy has to do half of no space to manouver)
pushable maze (one stone in a maze, can push from the outside)
stone ride. get up a stone and a guy, then ride em around
Bridge with dudes,
Bridge with blocks, that fall down.

remove entity serials ? // wwhat no!

Execute:
rotations
interpolation // done?
undoing path // done?
win // done?
maybe simulate to x while making path for x (in alpha?) // done?
UI stuff // done?
falling // done?
dying  // should this exist ? // insome sense done?
render numbers in path //done ?
clear, and let cubes fall, that go of the stage. // done?
QuatTree for Entity phisical stuff? // done?
carrying does not work, as its kind of a hack. // done?
stones jump to interpolation offset, and somehow look really ugly.. // done?
units should stop in pathcreator mode, maybe I should not check for collision, and just let eveything go to shit in the execute. that sounds fun // done?
do we have initiative? does stuff bump into each other and then back? I like that, that should look really "errory / errorish / ???" // done?
probably make the tree update based on create / restore / delete calls // done?

Undo data for game, so we can play in both directions, maybe the events are enought? // no, done.
undo does not really have to be a thing, if I do a Least commom multiple system.
speed meter
redo lighting, kd-tree for AABB's?
// make it just 4 u16 per triangle and work with the old system?

get rid of meshes having color? lighting should go into a seperate buffer that stores those colors
shift click for multi walk / control for unit select
victory currupts position right now  //does it tho?

upscale bmps

teleporters, moving platforms, ramps?
blocks on dudes? maybe only on blocks?, but what should be the fail? kill the guy?

make tags _existedInInitialLevel_, _alteredFromOriginalState_, so level load is faster? This seems hard

make _unit_ into active entity and gather infos about the stones and maybe platforms and such, 
	so we can actually generate the _production cycle_ and proof throughput and latency

clear flags in the begining, but do the sim at the end? // done?


what should happen?
guy _waits_ on a thing that moves									-> guy stays on the thing
guy _waits_ on a thing and gets pushed into a wall that is one up	-> guy maintains his position and maybe falls
guy _moves_ from a moving thing										-> motion should be relative
stack of falling things												-> things should fall together
guy _moves_ from a falling thing									-> guy should move as if the thing was stationary
guy _moves_ from a falling thing with something on his head			-> the thing on his head should get carried

stacks all moving in the same direction should be fast
pushing a stone while being moved?									-> motion should be relative

tried relative motion, it feels really weird, and everything is really _special casey_

-> falling flag,  that gets overwritten by movement.
-> things can only move, if they are supported
