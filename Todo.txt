Add the standart lighting to rendering. // done ?
reenable shadow mapping // done?
do a good StoF, so that we have a better mesh. // done ? (at least for now)
Are meshes assets? // no!
make the meshstruct work like it does in soko? having a vertex pool, an index pool and then have list {start index, amount, materialIndex}? // yes!, and now they do.
Make own mesh format and material format, that respects how the game wants to think of them // done ?
Asset system has to handle materials. // no

Make everything an entity, like they have in Sokoban?
Move to front Asset system? 

how to handle textured and untextured entities? Should there be such a thing as untextured entity, probably not.

associating data to triangles, to open gl... like normals.

lets make us be able to produce entities. (ground tiles.)
we are gonna have generation of tile, that have some values that you can tweek.



Get PNG loader

make debug Ui for amount of memory used.

somehow the colors of that consoleTextField got mixed up.... it seems that r and b are switched, why no where else?

round based stuff



we want to do like space chem, "input" output, where input are things like trees, or coal, or stone and output is a zone, that gets taken
