Make everything an entity, like they have in Sokoban
Move to front Asset system? 
Are meshes assets?
how to handle textured and untextured entities? Should there be such a thing as untextured entity, probably not.


make the meshstruct work like it does in soko? having a vertex pool, an index pool and then have list {start index, amount, materialIndex}?
associating data to triangles, to open gl... like normals.
